> **Storage:** A Database Cylinder geometry labeled "ChromaDB" at the bottom.
> **Retrieval:** An arrow leads from "ChromaDB" to a diamond shape "Re-Ranker", then to a Circuit-Board Brain icon labeled "LLM".
> **Style:** flat vector art, corporate memphis style, clean lines, geometric shapes, tech blue and grey color palette, white background, no gradients.
